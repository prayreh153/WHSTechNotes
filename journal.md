One game I enjoy playing is FC24. This is a football/soccer game that has real teams, players, and 
managers. The design of the game is good, having the stadiums exeactly like how it is in real life. 
The attention to detail in the game is also 
very good. For example, when the goalkeeper blocks the ball, the gloves are animated to move as it 
gets hit by the ball. The mechanics of the game makes the game very fun. You are able to do things 
that are impossible to do in real life which 
is fun. Overall, this game is one of my favorite games to play on my console.

Technology can help make food more affordable and accessible by using automated machines to grow, 
plant and harvest crops. This helped farmers to produce more food with less labor. With the help of 
technological advancements, there have also been developed machines that package and process food more 
efficiently. One of the disadvantages is that food processing can strip away many nutrients found in 
fresh foods. In addition, processed foods often contain added chemicals and preservatives, which can 
harm our health. Overall using technology with food can be good in terms of automating the process. In 
the other hand, food produced and harvested by humans is much better than by technology.

My thoughts on the tech industry is shifting towards prioritizing artificial intelligence (AI) skills 
over traditional tech roles is that it can be both good and bad. AI can be considered good when it is 
used to improve human lives by automating repetitive tasks. It can be considered bad when it leads to 
job displacement, amplifies existing biases in data, or raises privacy concerns. The benefits of AI 
come from more and better data about systems. AI can uncover patterns, give us a new understanding of 
how things work, and then optimize systems.

innovation if not carefully implemented, potentially leading to limitations on user access to certain 
features or services depending on the nature of the regulation. Technological advances in secure data 
storage, data sharing, data analytics, and data visualization have the potential to enhance government 
transparency and accountability. Increased data accessibility allows citizens to understand how 
resources are being used and whether programs are effective.
In my opinion, companies like TikTok can maybe use our locations to spy on us. One policy I would use 
to make the company safe is to make sure the user sees the terms and policies for the app.

On spring break I used a lot of technology. For example, the things I used most that was technology 
was my phone. I used it for entertainment, phone calling, texting, navigation, etc. Another thing I 
used frequently, was my ps4. When i'm not going out or anything, I stay home and play on the console 
by myself or with friends. 
Technology helped me in many ways. As I mentioned, it can help me navigate to where I want to go using 
google maps. Some technologies that I faced challenging are old tvs or computers. Sometimes they won't 
turn on, or the screen is slightly broken. The things we do in this class, I can relate to the games I

The technology going into predicting games such as the Marh Madness can be cool. But, it can take the 
fun and excitement out of predicting which team is going to win. The whole point of watching two teams 
going at it against eachother is to see the outcome of it, not knwoing who's going to win. Although 
the technology going behind predicting the games is astonishing, it overall takes the joy out of 
betting on which side is winning.
Social media can be a good thing in veiwing games. Sport accounts can publish live news on highlights 
of a game. Using technology, you can also view a game right on your tv instead of listening to the 
radio like old times. Tools like AR filters, live Q&A sessions, and virtual meet-and-greets make fan 
engagement more interactive and immersive. Social media has transformed athletes into powerful 
influencers, capable of drawing new fans into their sports by building personal connections online.
