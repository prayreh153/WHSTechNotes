One game I enjoy playing is FC24. This is a football/soccer game that has real teams, players, and managers. The design of the game is good, having the stadiums exeactly like how it is in real life. The attention to detail in the game is also 
very good. For example, when the goalkeeper blocks the ball, the gloves are animated to move as it gets hit by the ball. The mechanics of the game makes the game very fun. You are able to do things that are impossible to do in real life which 
is fun. Overall, this game is one of my favorite games to play on my console.
