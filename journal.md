One game I enjoy playing is FC24. This is a football/soccer game that has real teams, players, and managers. The design of the game is good, having the stadiums exeactly like how it is in real life. The attention to detail in the game is also 
very good. For example, when the goalkeeper blocks the ball, the gloves are animated to move as it gets hit by the ball. The mechanics of the game makes the game very fun. You are able to do things that are impossible to do in real life which 
is fun. Overall, this game is one of my favorite games to play on my console.

A career path in the field of computer science that interests me is a Web Developer. Web Developers design and construct websites. They ensure that sites run smoothly and offer easy access points with no loading issues between pages or 
error messages. Web developers need proficiency in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, along with knowledge of server-side languages like Node. js, Ruby, PHP, or Python. To be a Web Developer you will need a computer science degree program with core courses in systems design, data management, and the essential programming languages used by industry professionals. From being an Web Developer, you can gain in more jobs. You can work in a variety of industries, including software development, government, finance, healthcare, publishing, marketing, and more. They can work in an office environment or remotely. This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science because I personally like websites that smoothly runs and are easy to navigate through, and being able to design them is a cool job to have.

AI improves efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, and transportation by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and trends, enabling personalized approaches. They also make predictive forecasts, ultimately leading to better decision-making and optimized operations across various aspects of each sector. For example, in healthcare, AI can analyze medical images for faster diagnosis. In education, it can personalize learning paths for students, and in transportation. AI can optimize routes for increased efficiency and reduced costs. 
There are risks with AI poses such as job automation leading to unemployment, bias in algorithms resulting in discriminatory outcomes, cybersecurity threats from AI-powered attacks. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can automate tasks currently performed by humans, potentially leading to widespread job displacement across various industries, especially for repetitive, routine jobs. Malicious actors can utilize AI to develop more sophisticated cyberattacks, including AI-powered malware that can adapt and evade traditional security measures. AI systems often handle large amounts of sensitive data, making them potential targets for data breaches if security measures are inadequate. AI can be used to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion through targeted algorithms and social media campaigns.
