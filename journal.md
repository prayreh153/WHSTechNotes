One game I enjoy playing is FC24. This is a football/soccer game that has real teams, players, and 
managers. The design of the game is good, having the stadiums exeactly like how it is in real life. 
The attention to detail in the game is also 
very good. For example, when the goalkeeper blocks the ball, the gloves are animated to move as it 
gets hit by the ball. The mechanics of the game makes the game very fun. You are able to do things 
that are impossible to do in real life which 
is fun. Overall, this game is one of my favorite games to play on my console.

Technology can help make food more affordable and accessible by using automated machines to grow, 
plant and harvest crops. This helped farmers to produce more food with less labor. With the help of 
technological advancements, there have also been developed machines that package and process food more 
efficiently. One of the disadvantages is that food processing can strip away many nutrients found in 
fresh foods. In addition, processed foods often contain added chemicals and preservatives, which can 
harm our health. Overall using technology with food can be good in terms of automating the process. In 
the other hand, food produced and harvested by humans is much better than by technology.

My thoughts on the tech industry is shifting towards prioritizing artificial intelligence (AI) skills 
over traditional tech roles is that it can be both good and bad. AI can be considered good when it is 
used to improve human lives by automating repetitive tasks. It can be considered bad when it leads to 
job displacement, amplifies existing biases in data, or raises privacy concerns. The benefits of AI 
come from more and better data about systems. AI can uncover patterns, give us a new understanding of 
how things work, and then optimize systems.

Government intervention can significantly impact technology companies by influencing their innovation, 
data privacy practices, market competition, and user experience. It can also sometimes stifle 
innovation if not carefully implemented, potentially leading to limitations on user access to certain 
features or services depending on the nature of the regulation. Technological advances in secure data 
storage, data sharing, data analytics, and data visualization have the potential to enhance government 
transparency and accountability. Increased data accessibility allows citizens to understand how 
resources are being used and whether programs are effective.
In my opinion, companies like TikTok can maybe use our locations to spy on us. One policy I would use 
to make the company safe is to make sure the user sees the terms and policies for the app.

Technology integration in aviation can significantly enhance safety by enabling real-time monitoring 
of aircraft systems, providing pilots with advanced situational awareness, and automating critical 
flight controls. They can also utilize data analytics to identify potential hazards and proactively 
address maintenance issues, ultimately reducing human error and improving decision-making during 
flight operations. There are several existing and arising technologies poised to significantly 
improve aviation safety: Advanced navigation systems, like GPS, ensure pilots stay on course and 
maintain precise altitude, significantly reducing the risk of collisions and promoting efficient 
flight paths. Technology on new aircraft can either improve fuel burn through aerodynamic efficiency 
or reduce actual combustion use. Combined, these elements create a new aircraft with a reduced 
environmental impact.
Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS) play a critical role in enhancing the safety of aircraft. 
This technology uses computer programs and sensors to monitor the performance of the aircraft and 
adjust controls as needed, reducing the potential for human error during flights. Automation and 
robotics have significantly improved workplace safety by reducing the need for humans to perform 
dangerous tasks. Robots can be used to handle hazardous materials, work in extreme temperatures, or 
complete repetitive tasks that may cause strain or injury to human workers.

If I was a software developer working for an NFL team I would make an pplication that could have live 
player tracking with motion analysis, opponent trend identification, or predictive analytics based on 
current game state. I could also include customizable dashboards, and seamless integration with 
existing sports data platforms to provide immediate insights on player performance. For soccer, the 
application can analyze player positioning on the field, identify pressing opportunities, and adjust 
tactics based on opponent's build-up play. For Basketball it can identify optimal offensive matchups, 
predict opponent defensive strategies, and make informed substitution decisions. 

This technology can use gyroscopes, accelerometers, and other integrations that provide real-time, 
accurate data. Through these smart sports balls, athletes and coaches can get feedback that shows a 
player's performance, precision, and power. Players are fitted with wearable technology and AI-
enhanced sports equipment, enabling teams to track player movements and gain valuable insights 
throughout the course of a game. These data insights allow coaches and technical staff to make 
strategy decisions based on trends. Sports data analytics helps coaches understand how players are

practical level, lesson planning and the use of classroom resources. Using cloud technology, language 
teachers can create and maintain an organised online repository of lesson materials. Visual learners 
can use smart boards or tablets to draw pictures and look at other visual aids, while reading/writing 
learners can use the same media to absorb information or write down ideas. Music streaming platforms 
or audiotapes can be helpful for auditory learners.
Students can use interactive games to reinforce math, spelling, phonetic, and reading skills. Sites 
like Spelling Training permit students or teachers to upload their own word lists to practice word 
pronunciation and create interactive games. Technology is a powerful tool that can support and 
transform education in many ways, from making it easier for teachers to create instructional materials 
to enabling new ways for people to learn and work together.

The technology going into predicting games such as the Marh Madness can be cool. But, it can take the 
fun and excitement out of predicting which team is going to win. The whole point of watching two teams 
going at it against eachother is to see the outcome of it, not knwoing who's going to win. Although 
the technology going behind predicting the games is astonishing, it overall takes the joy out of 
betting on which side is winning.
Social media can be a good thing in veiwing games. Sport accounts can publish live news on highlights 
of a game. Using technology, you can also view a game right on your tv instead of listening to the 
radio like old times. Tools like AR filters, live Q&A sessions, and virtual meet-and-greets make fan 
engagement more interactive and immersive. Social media has transformed athletes into powerful

I believe such bans like restricitng phones duriing school hours are not a beneficial way to help students learn. Things like phones are something students hold dearly. Taking that away from students during school will only pressure them more rather than helping the focus. Teachers are allowed to have phones, but why not students. There are reasons such as students getting distracted by them but not to the point where it's completely banned from accessing it.
These policies can make students feel more trapped in school rather than wanting to come and learn. If the school I attend starts to implement these policies, I would probably switch schools. There's no actual reason to ban something that can be put away easily. I would be fine if a school holds someone's phone for being on it too much, but banning them is not the way to go.
