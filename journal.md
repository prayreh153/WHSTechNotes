One game I enjoy playing is FC24. This is a football/soccer game that has real teams, players, and managers. The design of the game is good, having the stadiums exeactly like how it is in real life. The attention to detail in the game is also 
very good. For example, when the goalkeeper blocks the ball, the gloves are animated to move as it gets hit by the ball. The mechanics of the game makes the game very fun. You are able to do things that are impossible to do in real life which 
is fun. Overall, this game is one of my favorite games to play on my console.

AI improves efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, and transportation by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and trends, enabling personalized approaches. They also make predictive forecasts, ultimately leading to better decision-making and optimized operations across various aspects of each sector. For example, in healthcare, AI can analyze medical images for faster diagnosis. In education, it can personalize learning paths for students, and in transportation. AI can optimize routes for increased efficiency and reduced costs. 
There are risks with AI poses such as job automation leading to unemployment, bias in algorithms resulting in discriminatory outcomes, cybersecurity threats from AI-powered attacks. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it can automate tasks currently performed by humans, potentially leading to widespread job displacement across various industries, especially for repetitive, routine jobs. Malicious actors can utilize AI to develop more sophisticated cyberattacks, including AI-powered malware that can adapt and evade traditional security measures. AI systems often handle large amounts of sensitive data, making them potential targets for data breaches if security measures are inadequate. AI can be used to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion through targeted algorithms and social media campaigns.

There's an event where I go to that showcases cars and its style. This could relate to computer science because to plan the event, people will need to publish the news online so people can see and show up for the event. Also the cpu inside of cars can control the car's idle speed, or the feul injectors. They also control the car's brakes, transmission, and airbags. Some people will have it tuned to get better performance in their cars for things such as getting more horsepower to go faster. 
Advancements in computing technology have significantly improved medical and healthcare facilities. The reliance on computer-related technologies is increasing in various lucrative industries. Science and technology for a sustainable future help us understand our environment and our impact on it, which is essential for making smart decisions about how to use our resources. It can also help us find solutions to problems, such as climate change and pollution, and improve the quality of life for all people. Computer Science has enabled the development of sophisticated tools that can help tackle environmental problems. Issues like pollution, waste management and disposal, disease identification and containment, and others can be easily tackled using computers.

Technology can help make food more affordable and accessible by using automated machines to grow, plant and harvest crops. This helped farmers to produce more food with less labor. With the help of technological advancements, there have also been developed machines that package and process food more efficiently. One of the disadvantages is that food processing can strip away many nutrients found in fresh foods. In addition, processed foods often contain added chemicals and preservatives, which can harm our health. Overall using technology with food can be good in terms of automating the process. In the other hand, food produced and harvested by humans is much better than by technology.

Artificial Intelligence is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions. They have the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. AI systems can learn, reason, and act in ways that would normally require human intelligence. They can also perform tasks that involve data sets that are too large for humans to analyze.
